Final Project by TheTophKids 
(Aidan Griffin, Woosuk Lee and Andrew Shao)

Our project simulates a traditional casino, with multiple mini games, namely
Texas Hold'em and Blackjack, that the user can play.
Players are given a balance and can make bets accordingly.
For both Texas Hold 'em and Blackjack, there will be a hierarchy to determine
who has the best hand and ultimately wins.

To run this program simply enter the lines
"javac Woo.java"
"java Woo"
into the terminal.

After typing "java Woo" in the terminal, the following will pop up:

How many rounds of casino games do you want to play?

Here, you can choose how many rounds of games you want to play. After you enter the number of rounds, the following will pop up:

Choose Your Game (Enter the number of the game)
1. Texas Hold 'Em
2. Blackjack

Now you can enter the number of the game you desire. (1 for Texas Hold 'Em, 2 for Blackjack)

Some things to be aware of in each game:
1. Texas Hold 'em
In this program, the user plays Texas Hold 'em against an AI. Each player starts out with 2000 dollars worth of chips. The user can decide how much to pay for the ante (ante is basically the price that both of the players have to pay at the beginning of the poker game). After that, the user can look at the cards in the hand and cards on the table to decide whether to keep playing or fold. The AI will also do the same. At the end of each game, the balance will be withdrawn/deposited accordingly.

2. Blackjack
In blackjack, the user plays against a dealer (Assume that dealer has infinite amount of money because he/she works for the casino and the casino never really runs out of money). When the user wins, the user will gain double the amount that was bet. When the user loses, the user will lose double that amount. When it is a draw, the balance stays the same. Initially, the user starts out with two cards and decides whether to hit or stand. The dealer will also do the same, and the victor will be decided.

Enjoy!
