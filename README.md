# Casino
Final Project by TheTophKids 
(Aidan Griffin, Woosuk Lee and Andrew Shao)

Our project simulates a traditional casino, with multiple mini games the user can play.
Players are given a balance and can make bets accordingly.

To run this program simply enter the lines
"javac Woo.java"
"java Woo"
into the terminal.

Enjoy!
