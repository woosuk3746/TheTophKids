# Casino
Final Project by TheTophKids 
(Aidan Griffin, Woosuk Lee and Andrew Shao)

Our project simulates a traditional casino, with multiple mini games, namely
Texas hold'em and Blackjack, that the user can play.
Players are given a balance and can make bets accordingly.
For both Texas Hold'em and Blackjack, there will be a hierarchy to determine
who has the best hand and ultimately wins.

To run this program simply enter the lines
"javac Woo.java"
"java Woo"
into the terminal.

Enjoy!
